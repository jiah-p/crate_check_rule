# Description

During a security audit, [Radically Open Security](https://www.radicallyopensecurity.com/) discovered several reachable `edge` cases which allow an attacker to trigger rpgp crashes by providing crafted data.

`rPGP` is a pure Rust implementation of OpenPGP. Prior to `0.14.1`, `rPGP` allows an attacker to trigger rpgp crashes by providing crafted data. This vulnerability is fixed in `0.14.1`.

## Impact 

When processing malformed input, rpgp can run into Rust panics which halt the program.

This can happen in the following scenarios:

Parsing OpenPGP messages from binary or armor format
Decrypting OpenPGP messages via `decrypt_with_password()`
Parsing or converting public keys
Parsing signed cleartext messages from armor format
Using malformed private keys to sign or encrypt
Given the affected components, we consider most attack vectors to be reachable by remote attackers during typical use cases of the `rpgp` library. The attack complexity is low since the malformed messages are generic, short, and require no victim-specific knowledge.

The result is a denial-of-service impact via program termination. There is no impact to confidentiality or integrity security properties.

## Versions and Patches

All recent versions are affected by at least some of the above mentioned issues.

The vulnerabilities have been fixed with version `0.14.1`. We recommend all users to upgrade to this version.
