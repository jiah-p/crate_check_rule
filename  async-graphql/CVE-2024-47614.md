# Description

`async-graphql` is a GraphQL server library implemented in Rust. `async-graphql` before `7.0.10` does not limit the number of directives for a field. This can lead to Service Disruption, Resource Exhaustion, and User Experience Degradation. This vulnerability is fixed in `7.0.10.`".

## Impact 

- Service Disruption: The server may become unresponsive or extremely slow, potentially leading to downtime.
- Resource Exhaustion: Excessive use of server resources, such as CPU and memory, could negatively impact other services running on the same infrastructure.
- User Experience Degradation: Users may experience delays or failures when accessing the service, which could lead to frustration and loss of trust in the service.

## Patches

1. Upgrade to `v7.0.10`
2. Use `SchemaBuilder.limit_directives` to limit the maximum number of directives for a single field.
